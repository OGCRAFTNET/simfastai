Hello everyone!

This is a project I've dedicated a lot of time to â€” a ChatGPT-like UI powered by the OpenRouter API.

Getting Started:
1. Visit https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys  
2. Create your API key  
3. Open index.html and replace PUT-OPENROUTER-API-KEY-HERE with your API key  

Thatâ€™s it! Your personal AI chatbot should now be working perfectly.

Please note:  
This project is intended for personal use only. Do not sell or distribute it commercially.

Enjoy chatting! ðŸ˜Š
